## Typing Speed Calculator with CustomTkinter

This Python application calculates your typing speed and accuracy. It uses the CustomTkinter library for a visually appealing interface.

**Features:**

* Countdown timer for a set duration.
* Text passage displayed for typing.
* Calculates typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy.
* Displays results in a popup window upon completion.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* CustomTkinter library (`pip install customtkinter`)

**Instructions:**

1. Install the required library using `pip install customtkinter`.
2. Ensure you have a text file named `textfile.txt` containing the passage for typing practice.
3. Run the script using `python typing_speed_calculator.py` (replace with the actual filename if different).

**How it Works:**

1. The application starts with a countdown timer displayed at the top.
2. A text passage is loaded from the `textfile.txt` for you to type.
3. Clicking the "Start" button begins the timer and allows you to start typing in the textbox below.
4. As you type, the application monitors your progress.
5. Clicking "Stop" or when the timer reaches zero finishes the test.
6. A popup window displays your typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy.
